Programs to aid in the development of RHEA -- Rotating Habitat for Exploration and Advancement.

## What is RHEA?

RHEA is the future of human settlement in space.

When it comes to living in space, there are many challenges both physically and mentally. RHEA is a project that aims to develop a working option that considers all aspects of space travel.

No matter how we look at it, gravity is an essential of our lives. Without it, our bodies degrade and deteriorate. Rather than accelerating linearly at a constant speed to simulate gravity, a space station can spin about one axis. This spinning motion generates an acceleration that can behave similar to Earth's gravity if controlled correctly. RHEA takes advantage of this physics phenomenon to assist in nurturing humans.

## Can I Help?

Yes! If we wish to reach for the stars, we need as many people as possible helping in this cause. Reach out to me if you wish to participate in this effort. I seek no profit other than achieving greatness for humanity.

This project was started by Sky Hoffert in 2017.
